# BUG BACKLOG

Non-blocking known issues. Append as discovered; strike through (don't
delete) once fixed, with the fixing commit/date noted.

## Open

1. **security-guidance plugin's agent-sdk-venv is a machine-global,
   non-git-tracked resource.** `~/.claude/security/agent-sdk-venv`
   (Python 3.14) can independently go stale/broken (observed once this
   session: `claude_agent_sdk` transiently not importable, stale
   `.building` lock present) without any change to this repository.
   `scripts/setup_claude_hooks.ps1` checks it on every run and warns if
   broken, but does not auto-repair it (repair = re-running pip install,
   which the SessionStart hook does automatically in the background on a
   fresh session anyway). Not blocking because `.claude/hooks/guardrails.py`
   (this project's own PreToolUse gate) does not depend on it at all.

2. **`_split_statements()` in `adaptive_scalper/persistence/database.py`
   is a naive `;`-split, not a real SQL tokenizer.** Fine for today's
   plain-DDL migrations. Would silently mis-split a migration containing a
   string literal or trigger body with an embedded `;`. Replace with a
   real tokenizer (or switch to one-statement-per-file) before adding any
   such migration.

## Fixed

- ~~`migrate()` wrapped `executescript()` in a manual `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`,
  but `executescript()` issues its own implicit `COMMIT` first, breaking
  the transaction (`sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot commit - no
  transaction is active`).~~ Fixed 2026-09-19, commit 4bd2f1b — execute
  each statement individually inside one real transaction instead.
